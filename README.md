# 🔍 MODULE 1: PestIdentify AI
## **Intelligence-Driven Pest Management**

**PestIdentify AI** is the core of our "Intelligence-Driven" philosophy. 

Instead of broad-spectrum pesticide application—which is costly and environmentally damaging—this module allows for **surgical precision** in pest control.

### 📋 WHY IT MATTERS

*   **PRECISION TARGETING:** Identify exactly which pest is attacking your crop.

*   **ECO-FRIENDLY FARMING:** Protect beneficial insects like bees by using targeted treatments.

*   **ECONOMIC IMPACT:** Reduces chemical waste and saves money for farmers.

# 🌿 MODULE 2: PlantHealth AI
## **Advanced Botanical Diagnostics**

While pests attack from the outside, diseases often destroy from the inside. 

**PlantHealth AI** acts as a digital agronomist, analyzing leaf pathology to save harvests before they fail.

### 📋 WHY IT MATTERS

*   **EARLY INTERVENTION:** Detects microscopic signs of fungal, bacterial, and viral infections.

*   **YIELD PROTECTION:** Prevents the rapid spread of diseases like Late Blight or Leaf Rust.
